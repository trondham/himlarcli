Dear NREC user,

During our periodic sanity check of security groups, we have
discovered a problem with a security group rule in one of your
projects:

  Region: $region
  Project: $project_name (ID: $project_id)
  Security Group: "$secgroup_name" (ID: $secgroup_id)

Security group rule details:

  Rule ID: $rule_id
  IP version: $rule_ethertype
  Ports: $rule_ports
  Protocol: $rule_protocol
  Remote IP prefix: $rule_remote_ip_prefix

The problem with this rule is that the IP address and subnet mask
combination is wrong: The subnet mask does not logically correspond to
the IP address:

  IP address: $rule_ipaddr
  Subnet Mask: $rule_netmask

The subnet mask "$rule_netmask" is wrong for this IP address. The CIDR
address $rule_remote_ip_prefix is effectively the same as
$real_ip/$rule_netmask. This probably means that your rule opens up
more than intended. According to our calculations, the minimum subnet
mask for the IP address $rule_ipaddr is "$minimum_netmask".

The purpose of this message is only to bring this to your attention,
you may fix this problem at your discretion. If this problem persists,
we will issue a new notification in $notification_interval days.
