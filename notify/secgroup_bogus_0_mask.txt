Dear NREC user,

During our periodic sanity check of security groups, we have
discovered a problem with a security group rule in one of your
projects:

  Region: $region
  Project: $project_name (ID: $project_id)
  Security Group: $secgroup_name (ID: $secgroup_id)

Security group rule details:

  Rule ID: $rule_id
  IP version: $rule_ethertype
  Ports: $rule_ports
  Protocol: $rule_protocol
  Remote IP prefix: $rule_remote_ip_prefix

The problem with this rule is that the subnet mask does not correspond to
the IP address:

  IP address: $rule_ipaddr
  Subnet Mask: 0

The subnet mask is "0", which negates everything in the IP address.
While it is legal to write "$rule_ipaddr/0", it is effectively the
same as "$ip_family_0/0", which is probably not what you want. It
looks as if you have tried to give access to a single host, but have
instead given access to the entire internet.

The purpose of this message is only to bring this to your attention,
you may fix this problem at your discretion. If this problem persists,
we will issue a new notification in 30 days.
