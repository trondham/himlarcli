Dear NREC user,

This is the $number reminder that your demo instance has almost
reached its end date and will be deleted in $enddate days.

  Project: $project
  Region: $region
  Instance: $instance
  Active days: $activity

If you need the instance for later use, create a snapshot of it.
For details, please visit the NREC documentation.

Demo projects are intended for testing the functionality of NREC,
and thus only for very short lived instances. Demo instances will
be automatically deleted after 90 days.

If you require a project for more permanent usage, you can apply
for one using the following link:
