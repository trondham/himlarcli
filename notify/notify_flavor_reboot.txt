Hi,

Due major maintenance on the NREC infrastructure in the OSL region, as all of 
the physical nodes will be moved to another machine room, these instances in
the OSL region will be rebooted on $date if they are running.

Affected instance(s) connected to your email $admin

$instances

These instances are running $flavor flavor. This flavor will be removed in the
future due to issues with live migration. Please consider terminating these
instances and start new using m1 or c1 flavor. We also have larger sHPC 
flavors. Read more about sHPC at https://docs.nrec.no/shpc.html

Support and contact information can be found at http://docs.nrec.no
