Dear NREC user,

During our periodic sanity check of security groups, we have
discovered a problem with a security group rule in one of your
projects:

  Region: $region
  Project: $project_name (ID: $project_id)
  Security Group: $secgroup_name (ID: $secgroup_id)

Security group rule details:

  Rule ID: $rule_id
  IP version: $rule_ethertype
  Ports: $rule_ports
  Protocol: $rule_protocol
  Remote IP prefix: $rule_remote_ip_prefix

The problem with this rule is that the netmask does not logically
correspond to the IP address:

  IP address: $rule_ipaddr
  Netmask:    $rule_netmask

The netmask "$rule_netmask" is wrong for this IP address. This
probably means that your rule opens up more than intended. According
to our calculations, the minimum netmask for this IP is "$minimum_netmask".

The purpose of this message is only to bring this to your attention,
you may fix this problem at your discretion. If this problem persists,
we will issue a new notification in 30 days.
