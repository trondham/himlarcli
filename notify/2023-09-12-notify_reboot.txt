Dear admin $admin,

Due to an issue in the current version of our OS and hypervisor combination,
together with certain generations of Intel processors, we are unable to live
migrate instances from some of our hypervisors when we perform our next
scheduled maintenance. These instances will be shut off by the NREC team at
12th of September between 12:00 and 14:00, and started by the NREC team 
when maintenance is done.

The following instances in your project are affected:

$instances


Please contact us if you want us to do a controlled migration of your
instance(s) to a hypervisor unaffected by this issue before the 
12th of September. In any case, the instance must be shut off, migrated
and started, but we can find a time that might suit your project better.
