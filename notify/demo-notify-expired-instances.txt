Dear user,

We have implemented a policy change for demo projects, which includes
automatic termination of demo instances after 90 days to meet
the requirements of standard projects.

Your demo instance has reached its end date and will be deleted in 30 days.

| $region | $instance |

If you need the instance for later use, create a snapshot of it.
For details, please visit the NREC documentation.

Demo projects are intended for testing the functionality of NREC, and
thus only for very short lived instances. If you require a project for
more permanent usage, you can apply for one using the following link:
